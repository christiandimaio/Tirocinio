	<p>As with all Guralp instruments, the manufacturer's calibration sheet 
	   for each serial number will list that instrument's most accurate bit weight.  When updating a datalogger 
	   sensitivity using a nominal response, not only is it necessary to change the value in stage 3 (the A/D 
	   stage), but also to recalculate the stage 0 sensitivity that represents the product of all stage gains.
