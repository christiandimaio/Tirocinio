	<p><b>Q330 HR(High Resolution A/D)</b></p>

	<p>The two sensor ports (QAPs) on the Q330 are sampled by different A/Ds.  Port A 
	   (channels 1-3) is sampled by a high-resolution A/D with four times the number of 
	   counts/volt as the Q330SR (standard resolution) A/D.  Port B (channels 4-6) is 
	   sampled by a standard resolution A/D identical to the A/D in the Q330SR.  The Q330HR 
	   preamp offers gains of 1 or 20.
