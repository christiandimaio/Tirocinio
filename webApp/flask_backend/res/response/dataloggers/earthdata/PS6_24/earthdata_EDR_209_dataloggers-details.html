        <p><b>Note:</b>
           The EDR-209 and EDR-210 dataloggers have the same instrument responses.  The EDR-210 
           incorporates internal or swappable storage media, wherease the EDR-209 does not. Both 
           EDR dataloggers also have the same instrument responses as the PS6-24 and PR6-24 models 
           with the exception that later models of the EDR-209 and 210 have a fourth gain option 
	   "Very High" (20nV/bit)
