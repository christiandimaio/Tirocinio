	<h2>Sercel L-28LB Sensor Responses</h2>

	<p>Coil and shunt resistance values affect the sensitivity and pole
	   values. To calculate poles, zeros and sensitivities for L-28LBs built with 
	   other resistor values, or to take datalogger impedance into account, click 
	   <a href="./passive_responses.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Note:</h3>
	<p>These responses assume that the input resistance of the attached amplifier 
		or datalogger is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the shunt 
		resistance.  If this is not the case, total dampling will not be 100% 
		assumed below and the poles will not describe the system accurately.
