    	<h3>CMG-5T Sensitivities, Clip Levels and Full Scale Voltages</h3>

	<p>Guralp CMG-5T accelerometers have adjustable clip levels and full scale voltage outputs that are 
	   custom set at the factory according to the purchaser's needs.  Clip levels, in units of g's, range
	   from 0.1 g through 4g.  Full scale voltage outputs can be set to 2.5, 5 or 10 Volts.  The nominal 
	   sensitivity in V/m/s**2 is</p> 

	   <center><i>[Full scale voltage / Clip level] / [9.80665 m/(g * s**2)]</i>.</center>  

	<p>Instrument-specific sensitivities in V/g can be found in their accompanying Guralp manual and divided 
	   by 9.80665 m/(g * s**2) to get units of V/m/s**2.</p>

	<p>The example response file here gives the sensitivity and for a CMG-5T with a 4g clip level and 
	   10V full scale output voltage.  The poles, zeros and A0 normalization factor for other sensitivities 
	   would be the same; only the sensitivity needs to be recalculated in stage 2 (sensor stage) and 
	   stage 0 (the product of all stage gains).</p>
