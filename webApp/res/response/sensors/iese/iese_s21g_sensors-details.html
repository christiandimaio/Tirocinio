	<p>Coil and shunt resistance values affect the sensitivity, damping and pole
	   values. To calculate poles, zeros and sensitivities for S21g built with 
	   other resistor values, click <a href="../sercel/passive_responses.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Note:</h3>
	<p>IESE does not list current damping or shunt resistor information, so response for 
	   the S21g is given with a calculated shunt resistance that assumes a total damping 
	   of 0.7071 critical.  Additional parameters needed to customize this response using 
	   the link above are as follows:
	   <table>
	      <tr><td><b>Fundamental Frequency</b></td>
	          <td><b>Mass</b></td>
	          <td><b>Open Circuit Damping</b></td>
	          <td><b>Intrinsic Sensitivity</b></td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr><td>2.0 Hz</td>
	          <td>0.023 Kg</td>
	          <td>0.61</td>
	          <td>78.7 V/M/S</td>
	      </tr>
	   </table>
	</p>
	<p>This nominal responses is valid when the input resistance of the attached
	   amplifier or datalogger is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the 
	   total resistance of the disconnected sensor.  If this is not the case, total 
	   damping will not be 0.7071*critical and the poles will not describe the system 
	   accurately.  Note that the response for the S21g 2 Hz sensor is the same as for 
	   the S31g 2 Hz and G88 2 Hz sensors.
