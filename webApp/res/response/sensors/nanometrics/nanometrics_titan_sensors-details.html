      <p><h3>Titan Sensitivities</h3></p>

      <p>The Titan accelerometer is available is several models, all of which are represented by the same responses. The Titan response is 
        determined by the maximum full scale measurement range the user selects, whether +/-4g, +/-2g, +/-1g, +/0.5g +/-0.25g or +/-0.125g.</p>
        
      <p>
          The Titan responses also apply to the accelerometer portion of the following integrated products, which contain a Titan accelerometer:
          <ul>
            <li>Trillium Cascadia Posthole, which contains a Titan accelerometer and a Trillium Compact seismometer.</li>
            <li>TitanSMA, which contains a Titan accelerometer and a Centaur-type digital recorder</li>
            <li>TitanEA, which contains a Titan accelerometer and a Centaur-type digital recorder</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Nominal sensitivity in V/(m/s**2) is calculated by (Full scale voltage / Clip level) / 9.80665 m/s**2</p>
