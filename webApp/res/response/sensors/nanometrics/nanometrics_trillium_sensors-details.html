      <p><h3>Trillium Models and Generations</h3></p>

      <p>There are several Trillium seismometer models that are represented by the same response, 
      for example the Trillium 120Q or QA vault, Trillium 120 Posthole and Trillium 120 Borehole models, 
      all of which are represented by the Trillium 120Q responses. Some Trillium sensors have been built with different feedback 
      electronics over time. These changes are referred to as "generations" and can be determined by serial number. 
      The table below shows this correlation.</p>

	<p>The Trillium Cascadia Posthole contains a Trillium Compact seismometer and a Titan accelerometer.
	   Please use the Titan responses for this accelerometer.</p>
