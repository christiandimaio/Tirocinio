        <h3>MTSS-1031A Sensitivities</h3>

	<p>Nominal sensitivity in V/m/s**2 is</p> 

	   <div><i>G in V/m/(s*s) = [Full scale voltage / Clip level] / [9.80665 m/(g * s**2)]</i>.</div>

        <h3>Voltages and Output Types</h3>

	<p>To translate the Sensor Output Voltage Level and Output Type from a R-Sensors calibration 
	   sheet to Full Scale Voltage shown below, know that the Sensor Output Voltage Level is the 
	   maximum voltage for the acceleration range or clip level from a single output.  
	</p>

	<p>If the sensor has, for example, a single-ended (positive) output and an Output Voltage Level of 2.5V, 
		a positive maximum acceleration would generate +2.5V.  Likewise, the maximum negative acceleration 
		would generate -2.5V.  Therefore, 
		<ul><li>the full scale voltage is +/- 2.5V,</li>
		    <li>the peak-to-peak voltage is 5V (+2.5 to -2.5), and </li> 
		    <li>the peak voltage is 2.5V.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	   
	<p>If the sensor has differential (a positive and negative) output and an Output Voltage Level of 2.5V, 
	   a positive maximum acceleration would generate +2.5V from the positive output and -2.5V from the 
	   negative output for a sum of +5V.  Likewise, the maximum negative acceleration would generate -5V 
	   from the sum of the positive and negative outputs.  Therefore, 
		<ul><li>the full scale voltage is +/- 5V,</li>
		    <li>the peak-to-peak voltage is 10V (+5 to -5), and </li> 
		    <li>the peak voltage is 5V.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
