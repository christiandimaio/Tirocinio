        <h3>RT131 Sensitivities</h3>

	<p>Nominal sensitivity in V/m/s**2 is</p> 

	   <div><i>G in V/m/(s*s) = [Full scale voltage / Clip level] / [9.80665 m/(s**2)]</i>.</div>  

	<p>The responses here apply to the uniaxial (1), triaxial (3), and borehole (BH) versions.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> The RT131A-02 was initially manufactured using the SF3000L 2-pole analog filter.  
		Subsequently, the SF1500S filter was substituted.  There should be a plate or decal on the 
		side of the accelerometer that tells you which type of filter was used.  If not, it probably 
		uses the SF3000L filter.</p>
