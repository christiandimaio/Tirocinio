        <p>The SS-1 comes with an adjustable damping resistor so that the user can adjust the relative 
	   damping for use with low-impedance recording systems.  This nominal response 
	   is valid for the case when the damping resistor is set to give critial relative damping 
	   when either no amplifier/recorder or a amplifier/recorder with sufficiently high impedance 
	   contrast is attached.</p>
