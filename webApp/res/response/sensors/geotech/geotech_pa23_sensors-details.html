	<h2>Geotech PA23 Accelerometer Response</h2>

        <p>These responses are for the S-230 (1 component), PA-23 (three-component surface), and PA-23BH 
	   (3-component borehole) accelerometers.</p>

        <h3>PA23 Sensitivities</h3>

	<p>Nominal sensitivity in V/m/s**2 is</p> 

	   <div><i>G in V/m/(s*s) = [Full scale voltage / Clip level] / [9.80665 m/(g * s**2)]</i>.</div>  

        <p>For accelerometers having other clip values (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0g), you can modify the response
           below by replacing 0.25493 V/m/s**2 in the stage 1 gain in blockette 58 with the sensitivity 
           calculated above.</p>
