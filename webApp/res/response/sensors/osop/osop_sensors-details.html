	<p>This is an internal geophone for the Raspberry Shake 1D integrated seismograph.  
	   Because its sensitivity is unknown independent of the datalogger, it is represented 
	   as unity in the sensor response stage.  When combined with the 1D datalogger, the 
	   cascaded response has the reported total sensitivity.
