        <p>These responses are for the EA-120 and EA-140 accelerometers having the standard 50 Hz high 
	   frequency corner.  (The EA-140 has lower noise than the EA-120 but the same response.  
	   Eentec offers the option for a 100 or 200 Hz high frequency corner.  These instruments are 
	   described by a different set of poles than included here.</p>
