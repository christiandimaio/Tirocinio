	<h2>OYO Geospace GS-30CT Sensor Responses</h2>

        <p>Coil resistance values affect the sensitivity, damping and pole
           values. The response given here is invalid for coil and shunt resistances
           other than those listed. It describes a level geophone with nominal attributes.
           It is always recommended that these nominal responses be updated based on calibration
           measurements for each sensor.  To learn how to modify these nominal responses
           for other resistance or calibration data, click <a href="../sercel/passive_responses.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>The response given here assumes that the input resistance of the attached
           amplifier or datalogger is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the
           sensor impedance.  If this is not the case, the poles will need to be
           updated.  This find out do this, click
