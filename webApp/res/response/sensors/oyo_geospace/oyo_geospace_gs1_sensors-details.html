	<p>Coil resistance values affect the sensitivity, damping and pole
	   values. The responses given here are invalid for coil resistances other than 
	   listed.  It describes a level geophone with nominal attributes.  It is always 
	   recommended that these nominal responses be updated based on calibration 
	   measurements for each sensor.
	</p>

	<h3>Note:</h3>
	<p>The response given here assumes that the input resistance of the attached
	   amplifier or datalogger is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the 
	   sensor impedance.  If this is not the case, the poles will need to be 
	   updated.  This find out do this, click
