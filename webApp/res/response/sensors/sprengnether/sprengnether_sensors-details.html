	<h2>Sprengnether Sensor Responses</h2>

	<p>Coil and shunt resistance values affect the sensitivity, damping and pole
	   values. To calculate poles, zeros and sensitivities for S6000s having other 
	   resistor values (i.e. damping values other than the 64% assumed below),

	<h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>These responses assume that the input resistance of the attached amplifier or 
           datalogger is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the shunt resistance.  
           If this is not the case, total damping will not be the nominal 64% assumed below 
           and the poles will not describe the system accurately.  To take datalogger
           impedance into account, click <a href="../sercel/passive_responses.html">here</a>.
