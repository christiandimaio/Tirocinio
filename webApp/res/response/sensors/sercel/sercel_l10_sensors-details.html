	<h2>Sercel L-10 Sensor Responses</h2>

	<p>Coil and shunt resistance values affect the sensitivity, damping and pole
	   values. The amplifier/datalogger impedance can affect these as well.  To 
	   calculate poles, zeros and sensitivities for L-10s built with other resistor 
	   values click <a href="./passive_responses.html">here</a>.  In addition, the L-10AR 
	   sensors have a fundamental frequency that can range between 10 and 14 Hz.  
	   The fundamental frequency value affects the current damping, which in turn 
	   affects the poles.  This link also shows how to calculate the poles for other 
	   fundamental frequencies.

	<h3>Note:</h3>
	<p>These responses assume that the input resistance of the attached
	   amplifier or datalogger is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the 
	   shunt resistance.  If this is not the case, total damping will change and 
	   the poles will not describe the system accurately.  See the above link to 
	   take datalogger input impedance into account.
