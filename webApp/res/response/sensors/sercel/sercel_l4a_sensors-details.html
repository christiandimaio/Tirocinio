	<h2>Sercel L-4A Sensor Responses</h2>

	<p>Coil and shunt resistance values affect the sensitivity, damping and pole
	   values. To calculate poles, zeros and sensitivities for L-4As built with 
	   other resistor values, click <a href="./passive_responses.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Note:</h3>
	<p>These responses assume that the input resistance of the attached 
		amplifier or datalogger is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the 
		shunt resistor.  If this is not the case, total damping will not be 70% and 
		the poles will not describe the system accurately.
