	   <h3>STS-2 Generations</h3>

	   <p>Streckeisen describes three redesigns of their electronics that resulted in differing transfer functions 
	      above 10 Hz.  Approximate times and serial numbers when new electronics were implemented are shown 
	      here, though older sensors that have had their electronics replaced may have newer generation electronics.</p>
