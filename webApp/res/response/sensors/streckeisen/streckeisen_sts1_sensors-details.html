	   <h3>A Few Notes</h3>

	   <p>The nominal poles and zeros here desribe the long-period behavior of the STS-1.  There is an additional 
	      LP filter having a single pole near 77 Hz that has been omitted.  If you wish to include this pole, you 
	      can either use a nominal pole value of -483.3 radians or calculate a more precise value using the RC 
	      measurements from your instrument's calibration sheet.  In addition, the calibration sheet should be 
	      used to obtain a more accurate sensitivity than the 2400 V/m/s value.</p>

	   <p>The STS-1 can be operated in 360 second or 20 second modes.  Both responses are included here.</p>
