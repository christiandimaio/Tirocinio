        <p><b>Note:</b>
           DAQ Systems is the vendor of NetDAS dataloggers.  There are four models: the 4, 4CH and 5V 
	   versions of the DAQ24USB use the CS5532 ADC chip, and the XR uses the ADS1255 chip.  
	   FIR filters are the same for dataloggers using the CS5532 chip, but sensitivities vary.  
	   The 4CH and 5V dataloggers have a Low and High sensitivity mode.  Sensitivities are as 
	   follows: 
	   <ul><li>4.1943*10^5 Counts/V for the DAQ24USB-4, and the 
			DAQ24USB-4CH and DAQ24USB5V at Low sensitivity</li>
               <li>2.796203*10^6 Counts/V for the DAQ24USB-4CH at High sensitivity</li>
               <li>2.843596*10^6 Counts/V for the DAQ24USB-5V at High sensitivity</li>
	   </ul>
	   The XR has different sample rates and uses different FIR filters that dataloggers 
	   using the CS5532 chip.
