	<p><b>Note:</b>
	   The SMART24 datalogger offers primary sample rates, from which secondary sample rates 
	   can be decimated.  Responses are listed by primary sample rate, followed by their 
	   available secondary sample rates.  Because there are multiple ways to obtain a given 
	   sample rate, finding the correct response requires knowing the primary sample rate 
	   chosen for acquisition.
