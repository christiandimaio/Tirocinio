	<b>About CMG-DM24 Mk3 Dataloggers</b>

	<p>The Guralp CMG-DM24 Mk3 Datalogger has two preamp options: </p:

	<ul><li><b>fixed gain</b> (bit weight 3.2 microVolts/count), and</li>
	    <li><b>variable gain</b> (bit weith 2.84 microVolts/count).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As with all Guralp instruments, the manufacturer's calibration sheet 
	   for each serial number will list that instrument's most accurate bit weight.  When updating a datalogger 
	   sensitivity using a nominal response, not only is it necessary to change the value in stage 3 (the A/D 
	   stage), but also to recalculate the stage 0 sensitivity that represents the product of all stage gains.
