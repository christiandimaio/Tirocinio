	<h3>Tap Table Lookups Numbers</h3>

	<p>The DM24 generates sample rates for each channel by cascading decimation filters 
	   to create up to 6 successive "taps" or sample rates.  Some or all of these sample 
	   rates may be output.</p>  

	<p>The FIR filters used for a given sample rate is determined by the tap sequence 
	   programmed into the datalogger at startup time.  Each unique combination of taps 
	   is referenced by a "Tap Table Lookup (TTL) Number".  Knowning this number is necessary 
	   to locate the correct instrument response, since a single sample rate can be 
	   generated in a variety of ways.  The TTL can be found in the GCF header of the DM24 
	   native format trace data.</p>
