	<h3>The Mk1 Standalone versus a CMG-3TD with integrated Mk1</h3>

	<p>CMG-DM24 Mk1 dataloggers have the same FIR filter cascade and tap table lookups as CMG-DM24 Mk2
	    dataloggers.  Sensitivities for the Mk1 standalone datalogger (wired for differential output) 
	    matches that of the Mk2 wired for single-ended output.  Mk1 dataloggers integrated into the 
	    CMG-3TD were wired with single-ended output.  For these instruments, use these responses for the 
	    Mk1 standalone and updated the datalogger gain (SEED stage 3) and total gain (SEED stage 0) by 
	    dividing by two.</p>

	<h3>Tap Table Lookup Numbers</h3>

	<p>The DM24 generates sample rates for each channel by cascading decimation filters 
	   to create up to 6 successive "taps" or sample rates.  Some or all of these sample 
	   rates may be output.</p>  

	<p>The FIR filters used for a given sample rate is determined by the tap sequence 
	   programmed into the datalogger at startup time.  Each unique combination of taps 
	   is referenced by a "Tap Table Lookup (TTL) Number".  Knowning this number is necessary 
	   to locate the correct instrument response, since a single sample rate can be 
	   generated in a variety of ways.</p>

	<p>The TTL can be found in one of these ways:
		<ol>
		    <li>running Guralp's EAMs program</li>
		    <ul><li>selecting "GDI channels display from the tools menu</li>
		        <li>choosing the data stream of interest and</li>
		        <li>clicking "View details".</li>
			<li>The "Metadata" table in the resulting display lists the "gcf-tap-table-lookup".</li></ul>
		    <li>retrieving the TTL byte by web interface 
			<a href="http://www.guralp.com/howtos/determining-fir-filter-information-from-gcf-data.shtml">(instructions here)</a></li>
		    <li>reading the Decimation Index (TTL) from the Scream "ViewInfo" window 
			<a href="https://www.guralp.com/documents/html/MAN-SWA-0001/s8.html#SubSection4">(instructions here)</a></li>
	    </ol></p>
