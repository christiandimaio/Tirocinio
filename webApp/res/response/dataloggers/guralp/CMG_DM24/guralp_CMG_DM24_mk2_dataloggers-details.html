	<h3>DM24 Mk2 Output Options</h3>

	<p>The Guralp CMG-DM24 Mk2 dataloggers have been manufactured with two output options having different bit weights:
		<ul><li>single-ended ( bit weight 1.27 microVolts/count), and </li>
		    <li>differential ( bit weight 3.2-3.5 microVolts/count)</li>
		</ul>
	   The responses given here use a nominal value of 3.2 microVolts/count (or 3.125e+05 
	   counts/V) for the Mk2 with differential output.  
	</p>
	<p>As with all Guralp instruments, the manufacturer's calibration sheet 
	   for each serial number will list that instrument's most accurate bit weight.  When updating a datalogger 
	   sensitivity using a nominal response, not only is it necessary to change the value in stage 3 (the A/D 
	   stage), but also to recalculate the stage 0 sensitivity that represents the product of all stage gains.
