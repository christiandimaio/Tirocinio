	<h3>Q412x Models</h3>
	<p>The Q412x series dataloggers are named according to the number of 
	   channels available (e.g. Q380, Q680, etc.).  Each of these models 
	   have the same instrument responses.
	</p>

	<h3>FIR Filters</h3>
	<p>The responses given here are a subset of possible Q412x responses.  
	   The FIR cascade for the Quanterra 412x is user configurable - the user 
	   can vary the filter sequence.  Gains are user configurable as well.  The 
	   responses given here represent the <b>default</b> cascade described by the following 
	   macro:<br>
	     <div><code>STAGE=1,2000,0.001663,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=2,400,FS2D5M,<1,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=3,200,F96CM,<2,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=4,100,F96CM,<3,>%CHAN_NAMES%,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=5,40,FS2D5,<3,>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=6,20,FS2D5,<4,>%CHAN_NAMES%,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=7,10,F96C,<6%M10_OUT%,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			%MFLAG%STAGE=8,5,F96C,<7,>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=9,1,F260,<7,>%CHAN_NAMES%
	      </div></code>
	</p>

	<p>The 0.1 and 0.01 Hz sample rates apply the Quanterra VLP and ULP fir filters to the 
	   default 1 Hz sample rate described in the macro.
	</p>
