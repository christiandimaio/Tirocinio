	<p><b>Firmware versions</b><br>
	   FIR filters for the 250 and 500 Hz sample rates changed on October 1, 2012.  Dataloggers sampling 
	   at 250 and/or 500 Hz need to select responses based on their firmware dates.
	</p>
        <p><b>Long-period sample rates</b><br>
           The 0.1 and 0.01 Hz responses come from the packet Baler, which decimates these channels from the 
           Q330S+ 1 Hz data stream.
