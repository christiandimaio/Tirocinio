	<h3>FIR Filters</h3>
	<p>The responses given here are a subset of the possible Q730 responses.  
	   The FIR cascade for the Quanterra 730 is user configurable - the user 
	   can vary the filter sequence a great deal.  Gains are user configurable 
	   as well.  The responses given here represent only the <b>default</b> cascade 
	   described by the following macro:<br>
	     <div><code>STAGE=1,1000,0.002663,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=3,200,FS2D5M,<1,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=4,100,F96CM,<3,>%CHAN_NAMES%,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=5,40,FS2D5,<3,>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=6,20,FS2D5,<4,>%CHAN_NAMES%,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=7,10,F96C,<6%M10_OUT%,>>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			%MFLAG%STAGE=8,5,F96C,<7,>%CHAN_NAMES%<br>
			STAGE=9,1,F260,<7,>%CHAN_NAMES%
	      </div></code>
	</p>
	<p>The 0.1 and 0.01 Hz sample rates apply the Quanterra VLP and ULP fir 
	   filters to the default 1 Hz sample rate described in the macro.
	</p>
