	<h3>Qx80 Models</h3>
	<p>The Qx80 series dataloggers are named according to the number of 
	   channels available (e.g. Q380, Q680, etc.).  Each of these models 
	   have the same instrument responses.
	</p>

	<h3>FIR Filters</h3>
	<p>Two version of FIR filters were used by the Qx80 series digital signal 
	   processor (DSP).  The first (tagged 900616 after the firmware version 
	   released February 1990) had non-normalized FIR coefficients. Each stage's 
	   gain varied slightly from 1, though the gain of the cascade as a whole was 
	   unity.  The second version (tagged and released 920812N) had normalized FIR filters.  
	   The LOG channel notes the firmware version in use at the time of recording.
	</p>

	<p>Typically, decimation for sample rates 1 Hz and higher took place in the 
	   Qx80's digital signal processor (DSP).  Subsequent decimation to 0.1 and 
	   0.01 Hz streams took place in the datalogger's M680x0 processor. The fir 
	   filter that decimated 1 Hz to 0.1 Hz has a gain factor of 4.
	</p>

	<p>A know exception to the typical cascade was used in the GSN network.  
	   GSN responses for sample rates from 20 to 80 Hz are identical, but 
	   for slower sample rates the cascades differ.  Responses for GSN 
	   channels sampled at 1 Hz or lower are listed in the last section.

	<h3>FIR Delays</h3>
	<p>Under the original Ultrashear system software, Qx80 systems corrected 
	   data time stamps for standard FIR filter delays, but did not include a small 
	   delay associated with data buffering.  Qx80 systems running the newer 
	   Multishear software had time stamps that were corrected for both delays.
	</p>
	<p>The responses given here describe Multishear data in that the "Estimated Delay" 
	   (Blockette 57, field 7) represents the delay related to the FIR filters 
	   and the "Correction applied" (Blockette 57, field 8) is the delay due to the 
	   FIR filters <i>and</i> additional buffering effects.  To modify these responses 
	   for Ultrashear data, set the B057F07 "Estimated delay" to the B057F8 "Correction 
	   applied" value.  (Both fields should have the same value.)
