    	<p>Optional IIR Low Cut Filter:</b>The ZLand Node has an optional Low Cut Infinite Impulse Response 
	(IIR) filter whose low-frequency corner can be set to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 Hz to remove DC 
	offsets, or Off.  The responses given here include the 1 Hz and Off options.  If you have chosen another 
	setting for this filter, you will need to choose the 1 Hz response and replace the pole value for this 
	stage with 2*pi*fc where fc is your selected corner frequency.</p>
