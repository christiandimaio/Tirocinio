	<p><b>Note:</b>
	   The K2 and Mt. Whitney dataloggers have the same responses and default A/D scale 
	   factors (counts/V).  The K2 can optionally be ordered with a scale factor of 4.20E+05
	   count/V.  To adapt these responses for that case, change the stage 3 gain (SEED blockette 
	   58) to this value and update the final stage 0 gain accordingly.  (The stage 0 gain 
	   should be the product of all stage gains at the normalization frequency of the sensor.)
