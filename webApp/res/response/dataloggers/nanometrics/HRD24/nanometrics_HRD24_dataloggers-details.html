	<p><b>Preamp Gains:</b> These responses reflect a preamplifier gain of 1.  Gains can 
		be adjusted by adding resistors to the A/D board to adjust for sensor impedance.  
		If the gain has been adjusted in this manner, these responses will need to 
		have their stage 2 gain adjusted accordingly.</p>

	<p><b>Optional IIR DC Removal Filter:</b> The responses given here that include the final
		IIR DC removal filter assume a low-frequency corner of 1 mHz (0.001 Hz).  The 
		corner can be set to any value of integer mHz between 1 and 1000 mHz.  For 
		other corner frequency values, the pole in stage 9 should instead be set to that 
		corner frequency times 2 * pi.</p>
