    		<p>The digitizers in the Meridian Posthole instruments are Centaur digital recorders with the six Centaur preamp gain choices 
		available.</p>

    		<p><b>Preamp Gains:</b> When configuring the Meridian Compact digital recorder, the user sets the preamplifier gain, 
    		which translates to choosing an input voltage range. Preamplifier gains of 1, 2, 4, 10, 20 and 40 correspond to 
    		Input range values of 40, 20, 10, 4, 2 and 1 Vpp respectively.</p>

    		<p><b>Decimation Filter Type:</b> The operator can configure the digitizer to use linear-phase 
    		or minimum-phase decimation filters. Responses incorporating linear-phase 
    		and minimum-phase filters are given below.</p>

    		<p><b>Optional IIR DC Removal Filter:</b> The responses given here that include the final IIR DC removal filter 
    		assume the operator has configured a first-order highpass filter with a low-frequency corner of 1 mHz 
    		(0.001 Hz). For other corner frequency values of a first-order filter, the pole in the last (nonzero) stage 
    		should instead be set to that corner frequency times 2 * pi. Other filtering options may be selected by the 
    		operator, in which case it is best to use the response generation feature available from within the 
    		instrument's user interface, or request a custom response from Nanometrics technical support.</p>
