    		<p>The dataloggers in the Titan SMA and Titan EA digital accelerometers are Centaur dataloggers with a single 
    		preamp gain choice of 1 (40 Vpp). The user may select the maximum full scale measurement range 
    		of +/-4g, +/-2g, +/-1g, +/0.5g +/-0.25g or +/-0.125g. This is applied to the internal Titan sensor, 
    		and so the Titan sensor response corresponding to the selected clip level should be used in conjunction 
    		with one of the digitizer responses below.</p>
		
    		<p><b>Decimation Filter Type:</b> The operator can configure the digitizer to use linear-phase or 
    		minimum-phase decimation filters. Responses incorporating linear-phase 
    		and minimum-phase filters are given below.</p>
		
    		<p><b>Optional IIR DC Removal Filter:</b> The responses given here that include the final IIR DC removal 
    		filter assume the operator has configured a first-order highpass filter with a low-frequency corner 
    		of 1 mHz (0.001 Hz). For other corner frequency values of a first-order filter, the pole in the last 
    		(nonzero) stage should instead be set to that corner frequency times 2 * pi. Other filtering options may 
    		be selected by the operator, in which case it is best to use the response generation feature available 
    		from within the instrument's user interface, or request a custom response from Nanometrics technical support.</p>
