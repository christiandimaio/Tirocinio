    <p>The High Gain Centaur models have preamp gains 4 times that of the standard Centaur models. 
    This is not reflected in the Centaur's user interface, so the operator needs to be aware that when selecting 
    for example 40Vpp range, the High-Gain Centaur is really operating with a 10Vpp range.</p>

    <p><b>Preamp Gains:</b> When configuring the Centaur, the user sets the input voltage range, which translates 
    to choosing a preamplifier gain. Input range values of 10, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 Vpp correspond to gains 
    of 4, 8, 16, 40, 80 and 160 respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Decimation Filter Type:</b> The operator can configure the digitizer to use linear-phase or 
    minimum-phase decimation filters. Responses incorporating linear-phase 
    and minimum-phase filters are given below.</p>

    <p><b>Optional IIR DC Removal Filter:</b> The responses given here that include the final IIR DC removal 
    filter assume the operator has configured a first-order highpass filter with a low-frequency corner 
    of 1 mHz (0.001 Hz). For other corner frequency values of a first-order filter, the pole in the last 
    (nonzero) stage should instead be set to that corner frequency times 2 * pi. Other filtering options 
    may be selected by the operator, in which case it is best to use the response generation feature 
    available from within the instrument's user interface, or request a custom response from Nanometrics 
    technical support.</p>
