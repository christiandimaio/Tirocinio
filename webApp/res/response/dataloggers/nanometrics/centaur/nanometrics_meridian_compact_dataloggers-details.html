    		<p>The digitizers in the Meridian Compact instruments use Centaur digital recorder technology with four 
    		preamp gain choices available.</p>
		
    		<p><b>Preamp Gains:</b> When configuring the Meridian Compact digital recorder, the user sets the preamplifier gain, 
    		which translates to choosing an input voltage range. Preamplifier gains of 1, 2, 4 and 10 correspond to 
    		input range values of 40, 20, 10 and 4 Vpp respectively.</p>
   		 
    		<p><b>Decimation Filter Type:</b> The operator can configure the digitizer to use linear-phase 
    		or minimum-phase decimation filters. Responses incorporating linear-phase 
    		and minimum-phase filters are given below.</p>
		
    		<p><b>Optional IIR DC Removal Filter:</b> The responses given here that include the final IIR DC removal filter 
    		assume the operator has configured a first-order highpass filter with a low-frequency corner of 1 mHz 
    		(0.001 Hz). For other corner frequency values of a first-order filter, the pole in the last (nonzero) stage 
    		should instead be set to that corner frequency times 2 * pi. Other filtering options may be selected by the 
    		operator, in which case it is best to use the response generation feature available from within the 
    		instrument's user interface, or request a custom response from Nanometrics technical support.</p>
