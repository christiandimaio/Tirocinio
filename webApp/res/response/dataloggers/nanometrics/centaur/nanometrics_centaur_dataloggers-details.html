    <p>These responses apply to all standard-gain models of Centaurs. The high-gain Centaur models are in a 
    different section of this library. Centaur digitizer technology is also used within all-in-one instruments 
    such as the TitanSMA, TitanEA, Meridian Compact and Meridian Posthole, and the responses of the digitizer 
    portion of those sensor-digitizer instruments are found in their respective sections of this library.</p>

    <p><b>Preamp Gains:</b> When configuring the Centaur, the user sets the input voltage range, 
    which translates to choosing a preamplifier gain. Input range values of 40, 20, 10, 4,  2,     
    and 1 Vpp correspond to gains of 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, and 40 respectively.</p> 

    <p><b>Decimation Filter Type:</b> The operator can configure the digitizer to use linear-phase 
    or minimum-phase decimation filters. Responses incorporating linear-phase and 
    minimum-phase filters are given below.</p>

    <p><b>Optional IIR DC Removal Filter:</b> The responses given here that include the final IIR DC removal 
    filter assume the operator has configured a first-order highpass filter with a low-frequency corner of 
    1 mHz (0.001 Hz). For other corner frequency values of a first-order filter, the pole in the last 
    (nonzero) stage should instead be set to that corner frequency times 2 * pi. Other filtering options 
    may be selected by the operator, in which case it is best to use the response generation feature available 
    from within the instrument's user interface, or request a custom response from Nanometrics technical support.</p>
