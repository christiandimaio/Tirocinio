    <p>The Taurus, Trident 305, Trident and EuropaT have identical responses with identically configured parameters. 
    The Taurus and Trident 305 have selectable low (43.07 kohms) and high (9.4 Mohms) impedance options, 
    but the Trident and EuropaT have a constant 43.07 kohm (low) input impedance.</p>

    <p><b>Preamp Gains:</b> When configuring the EuropaT or Trident, the user sets the input voltage range, which translates 
    to choosing a preamplifier gain.  Input range values of 40V, 16V, 8V, 4V and 2V correspond to gains 
    of 0.4, 1, 2, 4 and 8 respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Software Gains:</b> These responses reflect a software gain of 1. Software gains can be set to any 
    value between 0.001 and 100 by the user at configuration time. If the gain has been adjusted in this manner, 
    the stage 3 gain will need to be multiplied by this value.</p>

    <p><b>Optional IIR DC Removal Filter:</b> The responses given here that include the final
      IIR DC removal filter assume a low-frequency corner of 1 mHz (0.001 Hz).  The 
      corner can be set to any value of integer mHz between 1 and 1000 mHz.  For 
      other corner frequency values, the pole in stage 9 should instead be set to that 
      corner frequency times 2 * pi.</p>
