	<h3>Two Generations of Crystal Chips Used in the RT72-A07</h3>
        RT72-A07 digitizers used the CS5323 A/D chip on a RT331 board until about mid 1993.  About that time, 
	new digitizers came with the CS5321 chip on an RT371 board.  Both generations of the digitizer used 
	the same fir filters, but had different A/D scale factors that depended on input sample rate.  The 
	correct response depends on the manufacturing date of the instrument and, for older instruments, when 
	the boards were upgraded.
