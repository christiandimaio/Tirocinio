	<h3>RT72A-08 models</h3>

	<p>Responses for the 24-bit A/D channels depend on the simultaneous data streams (sample 
	rates) running on those channels.  Because of limitations in throughput, only responses 
	for up to 4 simultaneous streams are given.  They are organized by the number of simultaneous 
	streams.</p>
