    	<p><b>Optional IIR Low Cut Filter:</b>The SmartSolo has an optional Low Cut Infinite 
	Impulse Response (IIR) filter whose low-frequency corner can be set to 0.05 (DC Removal), 
	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 Hz, or can be Disabled (Off).  The responses given here 
	include the DC Removal, 1 Hz and Disabled options.  If you have chosen another setting for 
	this filter, you will need to choose either the 1 Hz or DC Removal response and replace 
	the pole value for this stage with 2*pi*fc where fc is your selected corner frequency.</p>
