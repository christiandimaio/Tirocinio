	<p>The DAQ3-3, Sigma 3 and Sigma 4 datalogger models all use the TI ADS1282 Analog-To-Digital Converter 
	   and have the same responses.  Each offers preamp gain options of x1 and x16, but digitized 
	   count values are scaled by the inverse of this setting before samples exit the datalogger.  
	   Both preamp gain choices are listed below for clarity, but the instrument response does not vary 
	   based on preamp gain choice.
